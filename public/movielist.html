<h1>The Best Movies According to Jake</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>American Gangster</h3>
<p>I love the aesthetic of this film, as I have always been enamoured by New York city. I love everything about it, the acting, costumes, soundtrack, character development. It is a perfect movie in my opinion.</p>
<h3>Nightcrawler</h3>
<p>Again, just the aesthetic alone made me fall in love with this film. The intensity, lighting, suspense, all tie together to make it one of my favourite movies</p>
<h3>Tropic Thubnder</h3>
<p>For the sheer stupidity and immaturity of the film it makes it onto my list of favourites.</p>
